# ML
This is a repository of my test in machine learning.  
Machine Learning is future.  
I don't want to be the last one.  

There are too many tools in this area.  
Based on my situation, Python will be the main language.  
Python 2.7/3.6 + Anaconda2/3 + pycharm + ipython.  
Maybe it will includes _scikit-learn_,_tensorflow_,etc.  

## scikit-learn  
I will use this tool to learn some basic algorithm and some basic data processing methods.  
The guide is a book I bought from JD.com and the official tutorials in [scikit-learn.org][1]  

## Tensorflow
It is opensourced by Google. One of the most hot tools in ML area.
The guide is a book I bought from JD.com and the official tutorials in [tensorflow.org][2]

I have given up many opportunities to learn. But I hope this time I can keep up.  
For revival. For future.
